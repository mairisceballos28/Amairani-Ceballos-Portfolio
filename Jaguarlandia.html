<p>Excerpt from “Jaguarlandia”</p>

<p>"I always thought that one's personal psychology, embodied in one's face, was the most interesting subject." – Chuck Close</p>

<p>Mr. Jaguar: How to find Jaguarlandia</p>

<p>The scent of salmon burgers and beer on a Friday afternoon was Ramon's definition of a "chill" Friday. Sitting on a stool close to the bar, he blew a Toscano cigar, waving off the gray smoke behind him.</p>

<p>His best friend, Miguel, was on a business trip, so Miguel's sons took it upon themselves to host Cigar Friday. This tradition had begun shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>If there was a sporting game on a Friday, everyone knew what that meant. The Red Hot Chili Peppers played in the background, much like the mellow playlist Ramon had made on Spotify. The bar sat at the back of the Sandoval home. Beer labels from all the breweries Miguel had visited over the years were sealed onto the table under a clear coat—permanent decorations, though many still tried to use them as coasters. With a minty breeze and greenery in the backyard, the Sandoval puppy found comfort lying on the couch and in its mother's lap.</p>

<p>One of Miguel's sons once prompted Ramon to share his thoughts through a presentation at a junior high school.</p>

<p>"I think I did well," Ramon said.</p>

<p>The Sandoval boys curiously pressed him: "What did you talk about?" As the laughter settled, Ramon remembered the day, recalling the career fair he attended. It had been a career fair day for the middle school students in Bell, CA.</p>

<p>One guest missed the entrance at first. After peeking inside, she looked confused. Each cautious step she took was as hesitant as coaxing a child with candy. The kids were playing a game of red light, green light. As soon as she walked through the entrance, the students erupted in synchronized applause, flustering her.</p>

<p>"How have you been?" Another woman greeted Ramon with a sincere, friendly smile as she sat nearby. She was a senior tour consultant, surrounded by other guests—a math professor, a sheriff, the City of Bell Mayor, and even an actress.</p>

<p>The senior tour consultant radiated enthusiasm in the social setting, her positive and endearing attitude standing out among the rest who had shown up for career day. Ramon took advantage of the brunch: fruit salad, donuts, and coffee. He was easy to spot with his long, warm black hair and brown skin. At least four sets of eyes focused on him as he gave a synopsis of his life. With every casual question thrown his way, he was far from shy.</p>

<p>"The first five years were hard!" he said, letting breadcrumbs drop onto his paper plate after rubbing his fingers together, then taking a sip of coffee.</p>

<p>Ramon was livelier than most people his age—more animated even than the thirty-year-olds. His perspective on life was free-flowing and refreshing.</p>

<p>"Oh yeah!" he exclaimed, recalling how he found a newfound sense of authenticity after his divorce. He knew himself better, as if he had shed layers to embrace his drive and passion for art. His eyes turned toward the well-crafted introduction by the organizer, and he said to his right, "This is about my fifth year attending this career fair."</p>

<p>A young junior high student wore her naturally long brown hair. Her black and white Vans complemented her casual black dress and cardigan adorned with festive ornaments. She gripped the microphone, eyes locked on her phone screen.</p>

<p>"I was shy... and after joining dance, it made me gain confidence... I want to graduate from college and become a criminal analyst for the FBI." Applause followed. The counselor came by with a broad, genuine smile and handed the microphone to the Latin ballroom teacher, who thanked everyone for their time and effort. The kids then performed a Latin ballroom dance recital they had learned in class. After the recital, Ramon made his way to his assigned classroom, feeling the bright energy of the morning.</p>

<p>In counts of twos, like the recital, Ramon's feet carried him to his assigned classroom. His free-spirited aura was immediately noticed in the room, next to a red-shirted McDonald's owner and operator.</p>

<p>"Welcome, Ramon and Patrick!" the teacher called, snapping her black-burgundy stiletto nails at a pair of chatty boys. The look she gave them was that of a mother testing her patience. With gestures and a casual attitude, Ramon adopted a Jack Sparrow demeanor, mimicking the pirate's hand gestures. "Hey guys, what's up... today I'm going to talk about my favorite subject—myself."</p>

<p>He knew what he wanted to say as if it were written on the back of his hand, though this time, he was in a time crunch. The class was half the size it could have been, with half the attention span of an unbothered cat. Most questions came from papers in front of them, each space on the assignment marked with eraser bits and doodles....</p>

<p>"You're at that age where you might need to start thinking about what you want to do in the future," he said, making eye contact and pacing the room, making them work a little harder to follow him.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty sure your teacher wakes up and thinks to herself—why the fuck am I here?" The teacher reacted like a schoolgirl who had never heard a professional curse in class. Her eyes widened in disbelief as she covered her mouth, hesitant to let out a giggle.</p>

<p>A student raised their hand to ask a question. "Someone already asked that," Ramon replied matter-of-factly, then emphasized his answer. "Reading is the best thing you can do for yourself! It gives you knowledge. Whether it's Chavo del Ocho or a history book, it doesn't matter." Some kids began to warm up.</p>

<p>"If you want money, don't be an artist—be a lawyer," he said, gesturing at a kid with lion-like long hair. "Who knows, maybe you'll want to have long hair like this guy when you grow up." The kid shook his head in disbelief.</p>

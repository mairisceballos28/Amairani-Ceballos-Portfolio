<p>Excerpt from “Sincerely Santa Ana”</p>

<p>A 1979 Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham cruises at low speed in the nostalgic movie-like essence in the dark late evening in East Los Angeles. The car's body is boxy and lengthy, it looks like it belongs to a driver with a sense of self-assurance. The presence of a lowrider doesn't just slow down traffic, it also turns heads. It's powerful in its presence. Under the warm night street lights on Whittier Boulevard, the car glows with its beige tone and an understated gentle light yellow-green-green tint. It is sleek and captivating, with a timeless body that gives you a spark of curiosity. The hydraulics steady the vintage vehicle onto three paws, leaving the front left wheel in the air as it cruises slowly. On the driver's side, you can catch a glimpse of black hair tied into a short ponytail. Not a single hair below the shoulder. The sounds of cop sirens go off somewhere in the background as the driver checks their rearview mirror. A few motorcycles pass by, and folks on the sidewalks enjoy the sporadic parade of lowriders on the street. One in particular stands on the back of a Chevy Silverado to record on his phone. The cruising keeps going with the steady eye of some cops monitoring the event. The same 1979 Cadillac makes its way in front of your view again. Only this time, the car passes by on the right-hand side near where you stand on the sidewalk. The car's front lowers as it cruises; in gentle movement, it bobs up and down as if it had a mind of its own, enjoying music. As it speeds up a little faster, the front wheels turn into hands, and the once-shy bobbing movements grow stronger, higher, and louder. Its nose lifts high into the air and slams down, leaving what feels like a centimeter from the ground, to avoid hitting the blacktop pavement.</p>

<p>This lowrider assembly occurred towards the end of 2023, in the city of Whitter, California. Soon after this event was documented online, in October, Governor Newsom signed Assembly Bill 436 allowing cruising to be legal in California. The Golden State has a rich history of lowrider culture, and it happened to be that legal systems were historically and systematically put in place to prevent cruising. It has been about 36 years since 1989 when anti-cruise ordinances were enacted. It allowed local governments to prohibit cruising as the practice of lowriding carried a reputation of being a gangster activity.</p>

<p>Santa Ana is a city that keeps you thinking. Like anything, there's a certain charm about something bad, like the quote "bad boy," except the city can be personified as a woman. Her first name in Spanish has a feminine connotation of holiness. She's the kind of person you find yourself curious about. You observe and soak up its quirks and why they have come to be. Santa Ana's population is about 300,000, the majority being Hispanics. When you walk down E First Street, you see the signs of a South California city. It has a vast amount of cars spreading around its city. One after the other into lines headed towards the light afternoon sun by heading straight down to the West of E First Street and the same amount of vehicles going East. As you walk, you can notice the subtle signs of gentrification in its downtown, old decrepit buildings in their grey element. Walking under the highway bridge on E First Street heading towards Standard Avenue, windows are old school--they are the tinted kind that push manually outwards. Down the street, you see many auto-themed local businesses.</p>

<p>Arriving to meet Tito Cano, a Santa Ana-raised Lowrider himself and organizer for lowrider cruising events that worked to preserve lowrider culture called "No Man's Land," at Joe's Local Garage and Moe, included in its surroundings were easy to spot sights like Pep Boys, a local carwash, and a shop that sells and buys used cars----all under 10,000 dollars.</p>

<p>"Hello, is there anyone named Tito?" An easy-going white man, with a long beard, pauses from glancing at his phone leaning on the table, and gets off the tall chair to look for Tito. Another Hispanic man with a navy t-shirt comes over and like a bouncer or airport attendant, unlatches the red belt stanchion. He was Tito Cano. The Lowrider Magazine follows him alongside at least 30,000 other Instagram accounts. He extended his hand for a handshake. It was as firm and peaceful as him.</p>

<p>"Let me give you a tour." Tito showed the items in the shop they used. There were brand new shiny car wheels----many of them piled against the wall. It was an auto shop-coded storage room for items customers requested for their cars. It also had a simultaneous restroom and locker room. Tito gestured to follow, outside of the garage room was the opened garage that let a vintage Cadillac breathe from its delicate and meticulous paint job. Passing the first long-bearded man at the high-seated table was the backyard of the mechanical shop. It had colorful graffiti art on the concrete wall surrounding the small perimeter that was enough to fit a dozen cars carefully and compactly parked. By the look of it, it was a normal day for Tito and his coworkers, one coworker washed a golden-themed Cadillac with a sud soap-filled sponge on hand----not surprised by Tito's interview....</p>

<p>"Well, it all starts, I guess, like with every kid's passion. You know, it all starts from being a kid with toys, and in this case, well, not your regular average toys, but like cars, model cars. From there, of course, you upgrade to cars---- no?" The coworker proceeded to hose down the automobile.</p>

<p>"There's body work involved. There's paint involved. You know, fabrication, cutting, welding, grinding--- everything." Tito was the kind of kid who grew up in Santa Ana looking for extra duties to earn some cash for his hobbies. He and his friends used to ride their bikes to downtown Santa Ana on the weekends asking people if they needed some extra help. Depending on the hours, they were lucky enough to earn anywhere from thirty to sixty dollars for a half-day shift on average. For kids who didn't grow up privileged, back in the old days it was a way to fund this way of life to build their projects aside from the tiny allowance parents would give to their kids. It was also part of the Hispanic culture, as soon as a kid were able to work using their intelligence or hands they were encouraged to work for their recreational or personal spending pursuits outside of school. Aside from earning money, they were able to trade to accumulate pieces individuals wanted.</p>

<p>"So we would trade. It was no different, trading a set of handlebars or pedals for a seat... You know, if my buddy comes and says, 'You know what, my car is like this, like that, but I'm missing this.' Oh, you know what? I got it over here, pick it up." Instead of a bright spark in the eye, more so he had a heartwarming energy emitting through each concrete detail he spoke about. You could tell why he was a leader in the low-rider community. "You grow up, you know, watching it on TV, or a family member, or you went to the store and you saw it in the street, and it just catches your eye."</p>

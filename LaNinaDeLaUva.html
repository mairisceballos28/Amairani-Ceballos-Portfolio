<p>Excerpt from “Nina de la Uva”</p>

<p>I tried to carry the ladder, but I was quickly humbled by its weight as it toppled onto my head. My father chuckled as he watched me cover up my urge to cry with frustration. “Mira.” He picked it up and carried it. The tall ladder looked weightless.</p>

<p>His office was the many fields of orange trees, kissed by the fresh morning air. He worked through the day, trying to fill as many harvest bins as possible. It was all by contract—the more bins he filled, the fuller his wallet. The trick was carrying a sack filled with oranges, ignoring the aching back and shoulder pain, and balancing the ladder with a lunch box in hand. But there wasn’t much time for a proper meal—usually, it was just leftovers from breakfast or a quick drink. There was no real break until at least 3 PM; Until it was time to head back home. Time was money.</p>

<p>It was hard. More difficult than I gave that old man credit for. A whole career of manual labor. The same routine. I was ready for retirement upon the first two days of working. He treated me like any son, there was no princess treatment as the objective was to work my fingers to the bone––using pruning shears.</p>

<p>At home, however, it was slightly different. I lay on the warm carpet at home, a tangled mess in front of the large TV. From my right came the same dramatic, evil laugh, followed by the crack of old knees. “¡Ya ves!” He stated amused. “¿Verdad que se siente como si tuvieras gripa? Tu mamá siempre me ve así tirado, y luego piensa que soy un borracho y flojo.” I turned back to face the television. “Aye,” I agreed. He left and encouraged me to rest.</p>

<p>––</p>

<p>I looked in the mirror and gave a satisfactory nod. My hair is quite long, my hands are daintier, and I have female collarbones–– I just am. I felt a man growing within as I started to get used to a routine. I had to wake up before five in the morning, something my dad had done since he was a kid. Nothing would become easier that summer. I knew I would see a change reflected in my mirror.</p>

<p>In the kitchen, the aluminum-wrapped food for breakfast was ready which was an easy and convenient meal. Eggs, tortillas, and condiments to one’s taste. It was a repetitive meal for me growing up. The food used to bother me, but not anymore. Like any kid, I was told about being grateful for what you have to ground your morals in humility. It got ingrained into me once I saw raw homelessness while in college. I remember booking a cheap bus that took me to the San Diego/Tijuana border for a flight... when I had an awkward encounter.</p>

<p>There were many chilling auras near me watching every person who arrived like a sneaky hawk. While waiting for an Uber ride on the Tijuana side, I saw a guy my age walking alongside his father. They both gave me space. To my instinctual relief, they were just looking for leftover scraps of food in the nearby trash can. It was disheartening to react that way, overthinking my actions, especially looking at their zombie-like appearance. New––but quickly worn out, like the young man's white shoes and Tommy Hilfiger jacket that kept him warm.</p>

<p>I rather eat those lovely burritos every day than go searching for them in a trash can. A trash can near any kind of transactional brothel–– cheap, expensive, and hopefully not free. It is a second thought behind a girl's ear. Not only being penniless, but penniless in the streets where you may be a commodity. That was my new story regarding gratitude. I was intent on making the most out of my summer harvesting grapes and tasting the rural lifestyle of a traditional Mexican mother working in the fields of the Central Valley.</p>

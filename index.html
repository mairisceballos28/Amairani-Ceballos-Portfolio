<p>"I always thought that one's personal psychology, embodied in one's face, was the most interesting subject." — Chuck Close</p>

<p>The scent of salmon burgers and beer on a Friday afternoon was Ramon's definition of a "chill" Friday. Sitting on a stool close to the bar, he blew a Toscano cigar, waving off the gray smoke behind him. His best friend, Miguel, was on a business trip, so Miguel's sons took it upon themselves to host Cigar Friday. This tradition had begun shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic. If there was a sporting game on a Friday, everyone knew what that meant.</p>

<p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers played in the background, much like the mellow playlist Ramon had made on Spotify. The bar sat at the back of the Sandoval home. Beer labels from all the breweries Miguel had visited over the years were sealed onto the table under a clear coat—permanent decorations, though many still tried to use them as coasters. With a minty breeze and greenery in the backyard, the Sandoval puppy found comfort lying on the couch and in its mother's lap.</p>

<p>One of Miguel's sons once prompted Ramon to share his thoughts through a presentation at a junior high school. "I think I did well," Ramon said. The Sandoval boys curiously pressed him: "What did you talk about?" As the laughter settled, Ramon remembered the day, recalling the career fair he attended.

        <div class="sample-content">
<p>A 1979 Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham cruises at low speed in the nostalgic movie-like essence in the dark late evening in East Los Angeles. The car's body is boxy and lengthy, it looks like it belongs to a driver with a sense of self-assurance. The presence of a lowrider doesn't just slow down traffic, it also turns heads. It's powerful in its presence.</p>

<p>Under the warm night street lights on Whittier Boulevard, the car glows with its beige tone and an understated gentle light yellow-green-green tint. It is sleek and captivating, with a timeless body that gives you a spark of curiosity...</p>

<p>Santa Ana is a city that keeps you thinking. Like anything, there's a certain charm about something bad, like the quote "bad boy," except the city can be personified as a woman. Her first name in Spanish has a feminine connotation of holiness...</p>
